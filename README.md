# Interactive Data Chart

This project demonstrates a simple interactive data visualization using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to showcase basic web development and data representation skills.

## View the Project

- [Live Interactive Chart](https://eliasorbon.github.io/interactive_data_chart/) - See the chart in action!
- [View Source Code](https://github.com/eliasorbon/interactive_data_chart/blob/main/index.html) - Examine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript behind the chart.

## Features

- Displays a bar chart representing random data for each day of the week
- Includes an interactive button to generate and display new random data
- Utilizes the Chart.js library for creating responsive and attractive charts

## How It Works

1. The chart initially displays random data for each day of the week.
2. Clicking the "Generate New Data" button creates a new set of random data and updates the chart.
3. The chart is responsive and will resize based on the viewer's screen size.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for expanding this project:

1. Allow users to input their own data
2. Add more chart types (line chart, pie chart, etc.)
3. Implement data storage using local storage or a simple backend
4. Add more sophisticated data analysis features

## About

This project was created as a learning exercise in web development and data visualization. While it uses JavaScript, the concepts of working with data and creating visualizations are relevant to data analysis in general, aligning with my interests in Python and R for data analysis.
